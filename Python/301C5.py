# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an 

# odd or even number

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many 

# days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.


# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 

# with our time left in this format:â€‹

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.



# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.â€‹

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡

age = int(input("What is your current age? "))

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†


#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

x = ((90 * 365) - (age * 365))
y = ((90 * 52) - (age * 52))
z = ((90 * 12) - (age * 12))
